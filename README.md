This is the PCB for the third generation of my project: Pathfinder. The goal for Pathfinder is to make a hexapod walking-robot that is able to traverse in diverse and rugged terrain where conventional vehicles (e.g. cars, rovers) prove inefficient. The third generation of Pathfinder (Mark III), will feature significant upgrades from its predecessor (Mark II). Including: improved motors for speed and weight bearing, onboard 7.4v lipo battery for tetherless power, an accelerometer, and an NRF chip for wireless communication.
