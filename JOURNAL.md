# June 18th: Finished the Box Plot

I finally finalized my box plot for the PCB! It's kind of heavily inspired by Aecert Robotics' design, but I got rid of the pressure sensors because I don't see a point in them. Also I'm going to use the Bno055 as the gyro because the one Aecert uses is kind of bad :/.

# June 20th: Made first Schematic :D

The box plot makes wiring so easy! Passives like capacitors are annoying tho (but that's what chatgpt is for). Good thing that datasheets give circuit diagrams though! However, there's a bunch of ERC errors and I don't think the nucleo footprint has nearly enough pins?
